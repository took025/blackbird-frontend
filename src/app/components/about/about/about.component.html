    When you run your hand along the weathered, amber-hued wooden pillars or
    when you're enveloped in the delightful scent of wooden structures, have you
    ever considered the mountains where the trees grew? Well-maintained forests
    nurture essential nutrients and minerals for all forms of life, which
    eventually flow downstream through rivers into the sea. Healthy forests are
    essential to sustain a bountiful land and sea where both people and animals
    can thrive
